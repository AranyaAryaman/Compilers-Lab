To execute the code, do the following: 

1) make

2) ./parser < file_name > output.txt


The desired machine level code is present in output.txt

Note: As understood from the question, our compiler doesn't pre-processes the given input file. So, it is assumed that the evaluator will not include any external libraries in the input file.
