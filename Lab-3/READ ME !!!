A) The whole folder contains two executable files:

    part1 - Assignment-3 Part-1 -> Counting number of comments, lines, etc as described in the assignment.
    part2 - (Assignment-3 Part-2 & Assignment-4) -> Fetching data from database if the correct Relational Algebra is given.

B) To run the program, cd into this directory, open the terminal & run:

    ./part1 : to run part1
    ./part2 : to run part2

C) The above two executables were formed using "makefile" to simplify the work of the evaluator. 
   In case the executable files are not available in the folder due to some issue, type "make" in the terminal and then run the executable files.

D) Please reach out to us at "arany170101011@iitg.ac.in" (registered email of Group-01 at 'turnitin') in case there is some problem during the online evaluation. 

Thanks & Regards
Group-01
